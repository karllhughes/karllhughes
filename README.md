## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Karl.

I [write](https://www.karllhughes.com/writing/), [speak](https://www.karllhughes.com/speaking/), and [help build startups](https://www.karllhughes.com/work/). After 8 years as a CTO in Chicago, I founded **[Draft](http://draft.dev/)** to help software engineering blogs produce high-quality technical content.

On the side, I run **[CFP Land](https://www.cfpland.com/)**, an automated newsletter that goes out to 2,000+ technology conference speakers every week.

I also have a [personal blog](https://www.karllhughes.com/) and I send out a weekly newsletter on startups, technology, and leadership called **[The Portable CTO](https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups)**.

ðŸ“– Thanks for reading!
