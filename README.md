## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Karl.

I [write](https://www.karllhughes.com/writing/), [speak](https://www.karllhughes.com/speaking/), and [help build startups](https://www.karllhughes.com/work/). After 8 years working for early-stage startups in Chicago, I founded **[Draft](http://draft.dev/)** where I help software engineering blogs create high-quality technical content.

I also run **[CFP Land](https://www.cfpland.com/)**, where I've built an automated newsletter that goes out to 2,000+ technology conference speakers every week.

I also have a [personal blog](https://www.karllhughes.com/) and I send out a regular newsletter for startup founders and engineers called **[The Portable CTO](https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups)**. Every week, I include a handful of tips, tools, and advice that I discover as well as anything new I've written across the internet.

ðŸ“– Thanks for reading!
